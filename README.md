# Bolt
Bolt empowers developers to create dynamic, responsive cross-platform applications (desktop, web, mobile), embracing modern web technologies while remaining backend agnostic.

### Vision
- Declarative Extensions: Extend HTML with custom attributes to define behavior without writing verbose JavaScript.

- Data & State Management: Seamlessly manage and pass data within your application, ensuring a reactive user experience.

- Hypermedia streaming: In desktop environments, leverage the power of local hypermedia servers to serve content at lightning speeds, ensuring near-instantaneous updates and interactions.

- Backend Agnostic: Bolt is designed to be flexible and backend agnostic, ensuring adaptability across various platforms and use cases.

### Getting Started
Bolt is in its early stages of development. More documentation, guides, and examples will be available soon. Stay tuned!
